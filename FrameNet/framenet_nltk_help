Use the following methods to access data in FrameNet.
Provide a method name to `help()` for more information.

FRAMES
======

frame() to look up a frame by its exact name or ID
frames() to get frames matching a name pattern
frames_by_lemma() to get frames containing an LU matching a name pattern
frame_ids_and_names() to get a mapping from frame IDs to names

FRAME ELEMENTS
==============

fes() to get frame elements (a.k.a. roles) matching a name pattern, optionally constrained
  by a frame name pattern

LEXICAL UNITS
=============

lu() to look up a frame by its ID
lus() to get lexical units matching a name pattern, optionally constrained by frame
lu_ids_and_names() to get a mapping from LU IDs to names

RELATIONS
=========

frame_relation_types() to get the different kinds of frame-to-frame relations
  (Inheritance, Subframe, Using, etc.).
frame_relations() to get the relation instances, optionally constrained by
  frame(s) or relation type
fe_relations() to get the frame element pairs belonging to a frame-to-frame relation

SEMANTIC TYPES
==============

semtypes() to get the different kinds of semantic types that can be applied to
  FEs, LUs, and entire frames
semtype() to look up a particular semtype by name, ID, or abbreviation
semtype_inherits() to check whether two semantic types have a subtype-supertype
  relationship in the semtype hierarchy
propagate_semtypes() to apply inference rules that distribute semtypes over relations
  between FEs

ANNOTATIONS
===========

annotations() to get annotation sets, in which a token in a sentence is annotated
  with a lexical unit in a frame, along with its frame elements and their syntactic properties;
  can be constrained by LU name pattern and limited to lexicographic exemplars or full-text.
  Sentences of full-text annotation can have multiple annotation sets.
sents() to get annotated sentences illustrating one or more lexical units
exemplars() to get sentences of lexicographic annotation, most of which have
  just 1 annotation set; can be constrained by LU name pattern, frame, and overt FE(s)
doc() to look up a document of full-text annotation by its ID
docs() to get documents of full-text annotation that match a name pattern
docs_metadata() to get metadata about all full-text documents without loading them
ft_sents() to iterate over sentences of full-text annotation

UTILITIES
=========

buildindexes() loads metadata about all frames, LUs, etc. into memory to avoid
  delay when one is accessed for the first time. It does not load annotations.
readme() gives the text of the FrameNet README file
warnings(True) to display corpus consistency warnings when loading data
